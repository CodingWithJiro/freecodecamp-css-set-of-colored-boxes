## ‚ÑπÔ∏è A Set of Interactive Colored Boxes Page

![Screenshot of the project](./screenshot.png)

## üîç Overview

This project consists of five uniquely colored boxes styled and aligned using modern CSS Flexbox. Each box includes hover animations to emphasize interactivity while maintaining a clean and minimal layout.

The layout adapts fluidly across screen sizes, switching from a horizontal arrangement on larger devices to a vertical stack on smaller screens. The result is a mobile-friendly design that showcases color, spacing, responsiveness, and basic animations.
