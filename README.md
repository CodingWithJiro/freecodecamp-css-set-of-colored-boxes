## ‚ÑπÔ∏è A Set of Interactive Colored Boxes Page

![Screenshot of the project](./screenshot.png)

A clean, responsive webpage that displays a set of interactive colored boxes using only HTML and CSS.

It was built entirely with HTML and CSS as part of the [**freeCodeCamp.org**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) CSS course.

## üîç Overview

This project consists of five uniquely colored boxes styled and aligned using modern CSS Flexbox. Each box includes hover animations to emphasize interactivity while maintaining a clean and minimal layout.

The layout adapts fluidly across screen sizes, switching from a horizontal arrangement on larger devices to a vertical stack on smaller screens. The result is a mobile-friendly design that showcases color, spacing, responsiveness, and basic animations.
